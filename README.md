# Cannonball for Android

Cannonball is the fun way to create and share stories and poems on your phone. Start with a beautiful image from the gallery, then choose words about #adventure, #romance, #nature or #mystery to complete the story and share it with friends.

## Introduction

Cannonball is a canonical sample Android app to demonstrate how to use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), the easiest way to build the best apps.

Cannonball uses many of the features available in Firebase, including Realtime Database, Crashlytics, Google Analytics for Firebase, and Firebase Auth.
